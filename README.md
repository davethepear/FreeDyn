# FreeDyn
DynDns has gotten to be rather expensive for personal use...

# Required to work
- Google Domain hosted domain name, like daveisagoober.com - https://domains.google.com - it's $12 per year for most domains.
- Set up Google Domain's Dynamic DNS - https://support.google.com/domains/answer/6147083?hl=en
- The user/pass from your fresh Dyn setup - read the above link but scroll to "Other options to manage Dynamic DNS"
- postfix ```sudo apt install postfix``` if you want to have it email you somehow
- the ip.php - you can put this on your website and it will simply give you your current IP...
